The dataset includes breaking strengths for just over 1,000 samples, their mix design, and the age at which the sample was tested.</p>\n<p>While the dataset contains samples broken at different ages, the standard age for concrete strengths is 28 days. This is the strength at which most concrete structures are designed with. Concrete strength does increase over time beyond 28 days. This increase, however, is generally not counted on by structural engineers and is why this project uses only the breaks made at 28 days.</p>\n<p><strong>Data</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength\" title=\"UC Irvine concrete compressive data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Concrete Compressive Strength [creative commons] from UC Irvine</a></p>\n<p><strong>Process</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Read csv data into a <strong>Pandas</strong> dataframe.</li>\n<li>Isolate 28 day breaking strengths.</li>\n<li>Classify 28 day records as having high, medium, or low strength.</li>\n<li>Using <strong>Seaborn</strong>, create a series of box plots for each mix ingredient for each breaking strength classification.</li>\n<li>Review box plots for trends in mix concentrations across the three breaking strength classes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Results</strong></p>\n<p>Below are the box plots showing the ranges of mix component concentration from low strength to high strength concrete strengths, all at 28 days.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/7//Screenshot-from-2025-01-04-09-07-03.png\" alt=\"Box Plots of Concrete Mix Designs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"428\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/7//responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-01-04-09-07-03-xs.png 640w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/7//responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-01-04-09-07-03-sm.png 768w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/7//responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-01-04-09-07-03-md.png 1024w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/7//responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-01-04-09-07-03-lg.png 1366w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/7//responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-01-04-09-07-03-xl.png 1600w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/7//responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-01-04-09-07-03-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>\n<p>While there is a lot of information in the box plots above it is the level of detail a structural engineer would like to see.  Going by component, the cement content increases with strength. This makes sense as cement is the binding agent that holds the aggregates together. As the cement content increases it displaces and thus reduces the aggregate content. Finally, the water content descreases slightly while superplasticizers increased. This too makes sense as superplasticizers are used to reduce the amount of water in the mix while maintaining the ability to work and consolidate the concrete.</p>\n<p>The entire project can be viewed in this <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gwA8R5vjOfh__89Og_c6CyTE0Oba2PLv/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colab Notebook</a>. It also includes some additional analysis to understand strength gains after 28 days as well. The study found that, on average, concrete strength increases by 21% from day 28 to day 365. Again, this is not generally relied upon in design but is useful to know as it provides an additional factor of safety on the design.</p>",

This project illustrated the relationship between ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and temperature. More specifically, it shows that ozone is highest in the summer when the ambient temperatures are highest and when ozone is high, nitrogen dioxide is generally low. This makes sense given that ozone is created by the combination of nitrogen dioxide, heat, and volatile organic compounds.</p>\n<p>Cluster breakdown by mean pollutant value in Adam's County, Colorado (highlighting indicating defining pollutant levels by cluster):</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/adams_cluster_values.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"147\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-xs.png 640w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-sm.png 768w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-md.png 1024w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-lg.png 1366w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-xl.png 1600w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>\n<p>Cluster distribution in Adam's County by month:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/adamsClusters2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"458\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-xs.png 640w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-sm.png 768w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-md.png 1024w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-lg.png 1366w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-xl.png 1600w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>\n<p>The mean pollutant values show that ozone is highest in cluster 1, when nitrogen dioxide is low. The distribution plot shows cluster 1 making up the majority of days during summer months. Then in winter, cluster 2 becomes dominant. Thus, ozone is highest in the summer when it gets hotter. When it temperatures cool off ozone levels go down and nitrogen dioxide levels are higher.</p>",
