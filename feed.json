Starting with the confidence, the rule is telling us that \"out of all structurally deficient bridges that have a deck in good condition, 73% of them have a substructure that is in poor condition\". The confidence tell us that \"43% of all structurally deficient bridges have both a deck that is in good condition and a substructure that is in poor condition\".</p>\n<p>Note that rules one and two both speak to the substructure being in poor condition. This was one of the major findings of this project. The bridge substructure is the most common structural element in poor condition among structurally deficient bridges. This was confirmed by looking at the percentage of structurally deficient systems in the set of deficient bridges.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/9/poor_structural_elements-2.png\" alt=\"Structural systems in poor conditions.\" width=\"744\" height=\"410\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/9/responsive/poor_structural_elements-2-xs.png 640w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/9/responsive/poor_structural_elements-2-sm.png 768w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/9/responsive/poor_structural_elements-2-md.png 1024w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/9/responsive/poor_structural_elements-2-lg.png 1366w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/9/responsive/poor_structural_elements-2-xl.png 1600w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/9/responsive/poor_structural_elements-2-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>\n<p>Here is a video presentation I made of this project.

This is the strength at which most concrete structures are designed with. Concrete strength does increase over time beyond 28 days.

This makes sense as cement is the binding agent that holds the aggregates together. As the cement content increases it displaces and thus reduces the aggregate content. Finally, the water content descreases slightly while superplasticizers increased. This too makes sense as superplasticizers are used to reduce the amount of water in the mix while maintaining the ability to work and consolidate the concrete.</p>\n<p>The entire project can be viewed in this <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gwA8R5vjOfh__89Og_c6CyTE0Oba2PLv/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Colab Notebook</a>. It also includes some additional analysis to understand strength gains after 28 days as well. The study found that, on average, concrete strength increases by 21% from day 28 to day 365. Again, this is not generally relied upon in design but is useful to know as it provides an additional factor of safety on the design.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>\n<p>This project sought to shed light on how air quality varies in Colorado over space and time. The goal was to perform statistical and machine learning analyses on air quality data from both mountainous regions and what we locally call the \"Front Range\" which is the urban region on the east foothills of the Rocky Mountains.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the only air quality monitor in the mountains was only active for a few years and was only intermitently functional when it was active.  Thus, the project pivotted to understanding how the Front Range air quality varies throughout the year.</p>\n<p><strong>Data</strong></p>\n<p>The dataset used for this project included 6 hour mean &amp; max particle measurements and 6 hour Air Quality Index (AQI) values for four air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. There were 35,000 observations from Colorado taken at three different locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Process</strong></p>\n<p>Using <strong>R</strong>, the following process was used to understand the relationship of the pollutants to one another and how they vary with time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clean data by removing observations from outside of Colorado.</li>\n<li>Perform a correlation analysis using the \"pairs\" function in the praznik library to see how the pollutants relate to one another.</li>\n<li>Factor records by county, AQI readings as either high or low based on guidance from Airnow.gov, and the season based on when the readings were taken.</li>\n<li>Use the apriori library to discern association rules. The resulting rules show when each pollutant is generally high or low throughout the year.</li>\n<li>Use the silhouette method to determine best number of clusters (2 in this case) for performing a k-means clustering analysis.<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/adamsSilhouette.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsSilhouette-xs.png 640w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsSilhouette-sm.png 768w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsSilhouette-md.png 1024w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsSilhouette-lg.png 1366w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsSilhouette-xl.png 1600w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsSilhouette-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure></li>\n<li>Perform k-means clustering on AQI values for each day of observations in the dataset</li>\n<li>Count the number of times each cluster occurs by month.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Results</strong></p>\n<p>The three analyses performed each confirmed the relationships of the pollutants to one another and through time through triangulation. This project illustrated the relationship between ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and temperature. More specifically, it shows that ozone is highest in the summer when the ambient temperatures are highest and when ozone is high, nitrogen dioxide is generally low. This makes sense given that ozone is created by the combination of nitrogen dioxide, heat, and volatile organic compounds.</p>\n<p>Cluster breakdown by mean pollutant value in Adam's County, Colorado (highlighting indicating defining pollutant levels by cluster):</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/adams_cluster_values.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"147\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-xs.png 640w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-sm.png 768w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-md.png 1024w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-lg.png 1366w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-xl.png 1600w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adams_cluster_values-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>\n<p>Cluster distribution in Adam's County by month:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/adamsClusters2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"458\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-xs.png 640w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-sm.png 768w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-md.png 1024w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-lg.png 1366w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-xl.png 1600w ,https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/media/posts/2/responsive/adamsClusters2-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>\n<p>The mean pollutant values show that ozone is highest in cluster 1, when nitrogen dioxide is low. The distribution plot shows cluster 1 making up the majority of days during summer months. Then in winter, cluster 2 becomes dominant. Thus, ozone is highest in the summer when it gets hotter. When it temperatures cool off ozone levels go down and nitrogen dioxide levels are higher.</p>\n<p>Here is my R code for this project on <a href=\"https://github.com/mattwilliams-ds/colorado-air-pollution\" title=\"Colorado Air Quality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">github</a>.</p>",
